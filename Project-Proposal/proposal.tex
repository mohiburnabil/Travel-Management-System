\section*{Introduction}
The travel industry is a gigantic industry that has grown rapidly during the last 20-30 years as people have become more interested in travelling because of technological advancement. The tourism sector of Bangladesh has a lot of potential and opportunity, but we need to bring technological advancement. There are hardly any renowned travel agencies or companies in Bangladesh which focus more on intra-country travelling than inter-country travelling. Most of the travel companies concentrate more on Hajj and Umrah packages. We have plenty of Facebook groups and pages which offer one to five days packages. None of the travelling agencies or companies in Bangladesh targets these smaller groups, and as these groups only operate through Facebook, they can't reach a lot of people. The web application we will build will break this barrier, and it will be a medium to connect tourists to these groups. The travel groups will offer packages where hotel, transport, food, guide and other necessary information must be provided. The tourists can choose any packages considering user reviews and ratings. There will be information about hotels, transport and guides so that anyone can do a little checking before choosing any packages. Also, there will be a section for blogging where anyone can share their experience and upload their vlog. One of the essential factors of travelling is photography and videography. This unique section of hiring a photographer or videographer will allow tourists to enjoy hassle-free travelling and capture memories.
\section*{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
\item To provide as many packages as possible to give tourists lots of options.
\item To give tourists all the necessary information about hotels, transport, guides, and other things so that they know everything before choosing a package.
\item  To create a platform for small, medium and large travel groups to reach more and more people.
\item To let people know about newly discovered places in Bangladesh through blogging and vlogging.
\item To open a new dimension for the photographer and videographers and save tourists from frauds.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section*{Target Customers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tourist – People who want to travel to a specific tourist place and need a package according to their want. They will choose their desired package using our service and get the necessary information about the hotel, transport, guide, etc.
\item Travel Group Admins/Travel Company Owners- Travel group admins or travel company owners who need more and more tourists. Using this service, they will be able to increase their customers. 
\item Photographer/Videographer – Photographer or videographer who wants to enjoy the beautiful destinations and earn. This service will help them make handsome money and travel around different places.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Value Proposition}
This web service will create a revolution in the travelling industry. The tourists now have to search every group or page they know and go through them to find their desired packages. In many cases, they have to choose either costly or unsatisfactory packages. This service will save their valuable time, simplify this process, and provide information about the hotels, transports, guides, and others. This service connects the tourist to the travel groups or companies in such a way that never happened before. Nowadays, small or medium travel group admins or travel company owners spend lots of money advertising on different social media platforms. Also, they can't reach lots of potential people. As a result, their groups or companies' names do not spread so much. They don't get their desired customers. Using this service, they will come close to a maximum amount of people, and their advertising money won't have to be split. One of the main problems in tourist spots is that the photographers there charge a lot of money for taking pictures of a person and these pictures sometimes do not come so good. Also, tourists become victims of fraud. Hiring a photographer may increase per head cost, but it will provide them with a premium photo experience and save them from any types of fraud. This service will also give photographers and videographers a part-time source of earning.

\section*{Challenge}
The biggest challenge for this project will be security. There will be much personal information and payment information of users and agencies. So how much our system is secure is a burning question to get answered. On the other hand, we have to properly understand the tourists' demands and monitor whether travel agencies are fulfilling their needs. Also, making the website extremely user friendly is challenging as the market is new. Understanding the travellers' demand is tough at this moment.
